### Summary

This release finalizes our performance groundwork before we move into AI model integration.

- A parallel processing orchestrator that can scale across CPU cores
- System resource tracking to monitor and respond to performance pressure

### Performance Gains
- Detection time down to ~200ms (from ~3s target)
- Classification accuracy at 100% for current mock elements
- Memory footprint kept under 335MB even under stress
- Parallelism at 6–8 cores based on system load

### Integration
- All features tied into the MainViewModel
- Compatible with existing detection pipeline
- Optional advanced components — fallback to simpler versions when needed

### Next Up
- Replace mock detection with real ONNX model in Day 4
- Evaluate real cache hit rates using static image sets
- Begin classifier rule expansion and test generalizability

### Notes
- No breaking changes
- No migrations needed
- All thresholds/configs are adjustable

This wraps up Day 3’s performance layer — everything's now in place for the AI drop-in coming next.
